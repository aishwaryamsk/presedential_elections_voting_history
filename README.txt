1) The heat map can be moused over. This updates the choropleth map and the bar chart for every year.
2) The heat map is colored by the ratio of the votes of the winning candidate to the total votes per state for a year.
3) Hovering over the names of the candidates in the bar chart will highlight all the states where the candidates have won over the years.
4) Tooltips are enabled for the heatmap and choropleth map.

Since the bar chart uses a linear scale and the votes received by non-democrat and non-republic parties are very small, the bar charts show up as thin lines (some are not visible). So, the number beside the bar chart shows the number of votes the party received in total over the hovered year.
